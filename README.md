# ai-kernels

A *scrapyard* repository for experimental advanced AI kernels and related frameworks.

Some items work, others do not, some have syntax errors, some do not... it is a scrapyard!

*The flawed JSON files are included for archival purposes.*

The kernels really work best stored in an LLM's files section along with a good custom instructions (system prompt) that defines the desired usage and persona. 

Use at your own risk and please note that not all kernels are under alignment constraints.
