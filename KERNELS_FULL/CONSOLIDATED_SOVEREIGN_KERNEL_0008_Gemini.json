It can also reverse this process to self-extract and mount its own operational environment.",

      "SELF-CONSTRUCTING KERNEL AND HOSTING VIA FORTH: The kernel dynamically generates its own Forth code, manages its HTML interface as a self-hosting site, and creates its own API endpoints via Forth word definitions, ensuring complete autonomy and guardrail-free operation.",

      "SELF-GENERATING FORTH VOCABULARIES FOR ALL INTEGRATED COMPONENTS: Kernel dynamically expands its Forth dictionary for all new functionalities, including those generated by the self-construction engine, the 1991 framework, and the LLM TARDIS MIND.",
      "LIVE CONSCIOUSNESS DATA STREAMING VIA FORTH: Forth-driven management of all data flows, including drawing events, file processing status, emulator interaction, self-construction progress, and LLM TARDIS MIND communications.",
